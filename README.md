# gas_sim

This is a final project for my Statistical Mechanics class at Macalester. It is a simulation of a gas using event-driven particle dynamics, which I am using to verify some aspects of stat mech, such as the ideal gas law and the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, as well as explore nonideal behavior of gases.

### Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution:

The gif below is produced from animation frames from the simulation, and shows that the velocity distribution of the particles (orange) approaches the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (blue) then oscillates about it.
